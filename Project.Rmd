Coursera Machine Learning Project
Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement – a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. In this project, your goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. More information is available from the website here: http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har (see the section on the Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset).
Data Sources
The training data for this project are available here:

The test data are available here:

The data for this project comes from this original source: http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har. If you use the document you create for this class for any purpose please cite them as they have been very generous in allowing their data to be used for this kind of assignment.
Please Note that I the code I use loads the data directly from the URL provided, so that you are not required to download the file to your environment. Please customize the code to your specific needs.
Project Intended Results
The goal of your project is to predict the manner in which they did the exercise. This is the “classe” variable in the training set. You may use any of the other variables to predict with. You should create a report describing how you built your model, how you used cross validation, what you think the expected out of sample error is, and why you made the choices you did. You will also use your prediction model to predict 20 different test cases.

Your submission should consist of a link to a Github repo with your R markdown and compiled HTML file describing your analysis. Please constrain the text of the writeup to < 2000 words and the number of figures to be less than 5. It will make it easier for the graders if you submit a repo with a gh-pages branch so the HTML page can be viewed online (and you always want to make it easy on graders :-).
You should also apply your machine learning algorithm to the 20 test cases available in the test data above. Please submit your predictions in appropriate format to the programming assignment for automated grading. See the programming assignment for additional details.
Modeling
1)	First task was to import the testing and training datasets. 
 
2)	Then clean up both the datasets to remove all the NA, NULL and NaNs in the data. Several columns appeared to be entirely metadata. These columns were dropped as any correlation that exists would likely be spurious and therefore cause the model to perform poorly.
 
3)	Converting new_window, user_name and classe from character to factor 
 
4)	Performing Cross Validation by dividing the training dataset further into testing and training datasets. 
 
5)	Prediction: - Random Forest algorithm was used as classifier on the training data which yielded an OOB error rate of about 0.13%.  
 
 
6)	Test the random forest prediction model on the testing dataset and build a confusion matrix.
 
 
7)	Since our model provided good results on the testing dataset we can test the model on the 20 test cases provided as a part of assignment using the predict function. 
 
 
8)	Generate files to submit answers for the assignment using the code provided in the instructions page on the course webpage. 
Conclusion
The random forest algorithm appears to perform very well for predicting activities from accelerometers measurements.
